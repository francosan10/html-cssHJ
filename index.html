                    <h3>01 / WATER</h3>
                    <P>
                        The Water Tribes are located at the poles of the planet, there are two: the Northern Water Tribe and the Southern Water Tribe. There are also a small number of waterbenders located in the swamps of the Earth Kingdom, called the Swamp Water Tribe. The tribes are home to men and women, some of whom can control water, a technique called Water-bending (Hydrokinesis). Those who use this technique are called Water Benders. The basic principle of the discipline of Waterbending is to use the opponent's strength against him. Waterbenders can easily adapt to different situations.

                    <P>
                        The Earth Kingdom is the nation with the largest area and population on the fictional globe of the Avatar World. It is one of the four nations that make up the globe and a large part of its surface is located in the Eastern Hemisphere, taking advantage of Asian culture for its beautiful landscapes and picturesque provincial cities. It is a confederate monarchy ruled by the King of the Land. A huge continent taking up most of the planet's eastern hemisphere, the Earth Kingdom is roughly analogous to Eurasia in our world. The Earth Kingdom is home to many world-famous Earthbenders. The capital of the Earth Kingdom in the great city of Ba Sing Se.

                    <h3>03 / FIRE</h3>
                    <P>
                        The Fire Nation is the most industrially developed. It is the only nation with complex military technology, and, unlike the Earth Kingdom and the Water Tribe, they have great knowledge of metal, how to purify it and mold it to create heavy machinery. As a result, it is the nation that has the most modern military technology, both maritime and land, and even thanks to an invention by "The Mechanic" captured by the Fire Nation, they also dominate part of the aerial technology so this is another nation that has the knowledge of flight, (although the Air Nomads were not a nation per se; unfortunately it is only technology based on Archimedes' Principle, therefore they do not master ultrasonic speeds due to the lack of an engine such as a combustion engine) .

                    <h3>04 / AIR</h3>
                    <P>
                        The Air Nomads were characterized by being the only nation in which all its members controlled the air (Aeolokinesis), which they called Air-bending. The discipline of Airbending is fundamentally defensive, with peace and sociability as its basic principles. Twelve years after the death of Avatar Roku, Fire Lord Sozin exterminated all airbenders, in his insistence on erasing the Avatar from the planet. However, he did not succeed, because ironically, the person he was looking for was the only one who was saved. Currently, Aang is the only known Airbender. Flying Bison tattoos are placed on an Air Nomad Master when he reaches a certain degree of meditation, wisdom, mastery of the 32 levels of Airbending and creating a technique of his own.
